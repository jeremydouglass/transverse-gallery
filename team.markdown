__Sarah Cifranic__ (3rd-year English Major/Linguistics Minor)
Sarah enjoys studying language and narratives. She is pursuing a minor in linguistics, and enjoys reading science fiction and classic literature. While working on the Transverse Reading Project, she has become interested in researching variations between Spanish translations of a text. She is especially interested in whether these differences are prevalent within specific genres. 
 
__Annette Ding__ (3rd-year Psychology and Comparative Literature Double Major)
Annette is an international student from China who is pursuing a minor in translation studies. In her free time, she likes to read, particularly fantasy novels, and more recently she has kindled an interest in Chinese historical dramas. Research for the Transverse Reading Project has lead her to an interest in the significance of title differences between different translated versions.

__Rachael Grainger__ (4th-year Film/Media Studies and Communication Double Major)
Rachael is interested in new media, technology, and culture. In addition to research and coursework, Rachael works as a graphic artist for UCSB Associated Students and has a cat named Pluto. She is interested in how metadata and graphs interact across foreign language gamebooks.

__Michael Loose__ (4th-year English Major)
One of the very few Renaissance studies majors on campus has somehow led Michael Loose to pursuing gamic study in literature, and a hopeful minor in UCSB's writing program. Hobbies include table top gaming, aestheticism, and Taco Bell crunchwrap supremes. What interests him the most about the Transverse Reading Project is looking at chance and reader choice, the effect of both willingly and unwillingly going through certain paths in stories, and how that changes our perspective of the medium.

__Juliet Way-Henthorne__ (4th-year English Major/Professional Writing Minor) 
 
Juliet's primary interests include speculative fiction, intersectional & socialist feminism, creative writing, and indie horror. On weekends, you'll find Juliet buried in grad school applications or napping with her dog. While working on the Transverse Reading project, she has become increasingly interested in the relationship between genre and narrative patterns, as well as the often overlooked value of visualizing elements like location and timeline in all literature.
