__Juliet Way-Henthorne__ (4th-year English Major/Professional Writing Minor) 
 
Juliet's primary interests include speculative fiction, intersectional & socialist feminism, creative writing, and indie horror. On weekends, you'll find Juliet buried in grad school applications or napping with her dog. While working on the Transverse Reading project, she has become increasingly interested in the relationship between genre and narrative patterns, as well as the often overlooked value of visualizing elements like location and timeline in all literature.
