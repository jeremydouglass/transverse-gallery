## Graduate Research Advisors

<br>
__Alanna Bartolini__ (English Ph.D. Student, UCSB)

Alanna, one of the Graduate Research Advisors of the Transverse Reading project, hails from Montreal, Canada. With research interests including the digital humanities, archive theory, and Victorian Gothic epistolary novels, she is largely interested in databases' potential to serve as digital editions and to perform narrativity. She loves languages, speaking English, French, and Italian fluently, Spanish and Mandarin poorly, and reading German, Latin, and the other romance languages (Portuguese, Catalan, and Romanian). For this reason, Alanna leads the Foreign Language Research Team, fondly nicknamed "i stranieri," - a playful double entendre on "strangers" in Italian, meaning both "the foreigners" but also "the odd ones" - and of whom she is proud to be head straniera.

## Undergraduate Research Fellows

__Sami Stebbins__ (3rd-year Communication Major/ Spanish and Professional Writing Double Minor, UCSB) 2019

Sami just finished two years juggling the UCSB Honors Program, UCSB Division One Water Polo, and her incredible obsession with Spider-Man, and continues to pursue her major in Communication with the hope of one day going into a job in Public Relations. Her dream is to one day embark on an adventure so grand that the world sings her praises for years to come, but in the mean time she gets her thrills coding Doctor Who gamebooks for the Transverse Reading Project–– an adventure altogether electrifying in its own right. She is quite interested in how gamebooks have the potential to be a teaching force for audiences to learn about the consequences of their actions.
